"""
Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5.

Example 1:

Input: 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 × 3
Example 2:

Input: 8
Output: true
Explanation: 8 = 2 × 2 × 2
Example 3:

Input: 14
Output: false 
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7.

explanation, mathematical proof:
N=(a[0] * 1 + a[1] * 10 + ...a[n] * 10 ^n),and a[0]...a[n] are all between [0,9]
we set M = a[0] + a[1] + ..a[n]
and another truth is that:
1 % 9 = 1
10 % 9 = 1
100 % 9 = 1
so N % 9 = a[0] + a[1] + ..a[n]
means N % 9 = M
so N = M (% 9)

"""
Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.

Example:

Input: 38
Output: 2 
Explanation: The process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. 
             Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
Follow up:
Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?

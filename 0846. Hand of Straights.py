"""
Alice has a hand of cards, given as an array of integers.

Now she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is size W, and consists of W consecutive cards.

Return true if and only if she can.

 

Example 1:

Input: hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], W = 3
Output: true
Explanation: Alice's hand can be rearranged as [1,2,3],[2,3,4],[6,7,8].
Example 2:

Input: hand = [1,2,3,4,5], W = 4
Output: false
Explanation: Alice's hand can't be rearranged into groups of 4.
 

Note:

1 <= hand.length <= 10000
0 <= hand[i] <= 10^9
1 <= W <= hand.length

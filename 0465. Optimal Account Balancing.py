"""
A group of friends went on holiday and sometimes 
lent each other money. For example, Alice paid for Bill's lunch for $10. 
Then later Chris gave Alice $5 for a taxi ride. 
We can model each transaction as a tuple (x, y, z) 
which means person x gave person y $z. 
Assuming Alice, Bill, and Chris are person 0, 1, and 2 
respectively (0, 1, 2 are the person's ID), 
the transactions can be represented as [[0, 1, 10], [2, 0, 5]].

Given a list of transactions between a group of people, 
return the minimum number of transactions required to settle the debt.

Note:

A transaction will be given as a tuple (x, y, z). 
Note that x â‰  y and z > 0.
Person's IDs may not be linear, e.g. we could have the persons 0, 1, 2 
or we could also have the persons 0, 2, 6.
Example 1:

Input:
[[0,1,10], [2,0,5]]

Output:
2

Explanation:
Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
Person #2 gave person #0 $5.

Two transactions are needed. One way to settle the debt is person #1 
pays person #0 and #2 $5 each.
